# magit-gerrit-plus

The goal of this project is to enable you to do code review for a gerrit-based
project right inside Emacs.  You should be able to list open patches for your
current project, download them, see the diff in Emacs, add comments inline, and
submit your comments for review along with any votes (+1, etc).

## Status

Very early stages.
